# Hello and Welcome to Tanny/'s treasure hunt!

As an adventure enthusiast, you have stumbled upon one of Segovia's most intimate and mysterious treasure hunts yet
Years ago, before Segovia became the tourist attraction we now know, it was plagued with mysteries. The biggest one being the **name**'s treasure.
For years, **name**/'s house has been left untouched and many believe it is now haunted by the ghosts of those who tried to find the treasure he left behind.
No one knows what lies inside. Many say a promise of fulfilling desires while others argue it's the biggest fortune a man can lay its eyes upon...
All have tried and failed until you... the treasure is hidden in an unknown room you have to get to but be careful, every decision brings you either one step closer to the treasure and exit or one step closer to certain demise.
Each room contains different objects to help you find the treasure and escape. Each room is a differen colour to help you differentiate
and locate where you are on the haunted house map.
